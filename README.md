## 🚀 Installation

To get started with Taskphrena locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iwybadly/taskphrena.git
   ```

2. **Install XAMPP:**

    You will need XAMPP to be able to run Taskphrena, as it is the program that runs Apache (the web server) and MySQL (the database).

    If you don't have XAMPP, you can download it from here.
    ```bash
    https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html
    ```
    Once downloaded, install and open XAMPP.

    In the XAMPP control panel, click Start to start Apache and MySQL. This will enable your computer to serve the web application and manage the database.

3. **Configure the data base:**

    Taskphrena needs a database to store the tasks it creates. You need to set it up in MySQL:

    Open the XAMPP control panel and click Admin next to MySQL. This will open phpMyAdmin in your browser.

    In phpMyAdmin, import taskphrena.sql.

    Make sure MySQL has port 3306 open.
